Privacy Policy
==

At this time, we don't even keep any data or any information about any of our users, so we don't have anything to give away or sell. Your secrets are safe with us. However, we do reserve the right to modify this at any time, without notice, though we'll at least try to provide some, with the exception of extremely minor edits (like spelling fixes)
